#Create a file named 4.8.3_numpy_exercises.py for this exercise.
#Use the following code for the questions below:

a = np.array([4, 10, 12, 23, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, -6, 3, -7])


#1.) How many negative numbers are there?

a = b
b[b < 0]

print(len(a[b]))
answer: 5

# 2.) How many positive numbers are there?
a = b
b[b >= 0]
print(len(b[b >= 0]))

answer: 8


# 3.) How many even positive numbers are there?
a = np.array([4, 10, 12, 23, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, -6, 3, -7])

print(len(a[(a >= 0) & (a % 2 == 0) ]))
answer: 6

# 4.) If you were to add 3 to each data point, how many positive numbers would there be?
a = np.array([4, 10, 12, 23, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, -6, 3, -7])

a = a + 3
print(a)

# 5.) If you squared each number, what would the new mean and standard deviation be?
a = np.array([4, 10, 12, 23, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, -6, 3, -7])

b = a**2
b.mean()
print(b.std())
c = b.std()

#mean = 74.0
#Std = 144.0243035046516

# 6.) A common statistical operation on a dataset is centering. 
# This means to adjust the data such that the center of the data is at 0. 
# This is done by subtracting the mean from each data point. Center the data set

a = np.array([4, 10, 12, 23, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, -6, 3, -7])

b = a.mean()
c = a - b
print(c)

#output: [  1.   7.   9.  20.  -5.  -4.  -3.  -3.  -3.  -9.   0. -10.]

# 7.) Calculate the z-score for each data point. Recall that the z-score is given by:
ùëç=(ùë•‚àíŒº)/œÉ

a = np.array([4, 10, 12, 23, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, -6, 3, -7])

b = a.mean()
c = a.std()
z_score = (a - b) / c
print(z_score)

#answer: [ 0.12403473  0.86824314  1.11631261  2.48069469 -0.62017367 -0.49613894

# Life w/o numpy to life with numpy

## Setup 1
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Use python's built in functionality/operators to determine the following:
# Exercise 1 - Make a variable called sum_of_a to hold the sum of all the numbers in above list
sum_of_a = sum(a)

# Exercise 2 - Make a variable named min_of_a to hold the minimum of all the numbers in the above list
min_of_a = min(a)

# Exercise 3 - Make a variable named max_of_a to hold the max number of all the numbers in the above list
max_of_a = max(a)

# Exercise 4 - Make a variable named mean_of_a to hold the average of all the numbers in the above list
mean_of_a = a / len(a)

# Exercise 5 - Make a variable named product_of_a to hold the product of multiplying all the 
# numbers in the above list together
product_of_a = sum([n * n for n in a])

# Exercise 6 - Make a variable named squares_of_a. It should hold each number in a squared like [1, 4, 9, 16, 25...]
squares_of_a = [n**2 for n in a]

# Exercise 7 - Make a variable named odds_in_a. It should hold only the odd numbers
odds_in_a = [n for n in a if n % 2 == 1]

# Exercise 8 - Make a variable named evens_in_a. It should hold only the evens.
evens_in_a = [n for n in a if n % 2 == 0]

## What about life in two dimensions? A list of lists is matrix, a table, a spreadsheet, a chessboard...
## Setup 2: Consider what it would take to find the sum, min, max, average, 
# sum, product, and list of squares for this list of two lists.
b = [[3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8]]


# Exercise 1 - refactor the following to use numpy. 
# Use sum_of_b as the variable. **Hint, you'll first 
# need to make sure that the "b" variable is a numpy array**
sum_of_b = 0
for row in b:
    sum_of_b += sum(row)


sum_of_b = np.sum(b)    

# Exercise 2 - refactor the following to use numpy. 
min_of_b = min(b[0]) if min(b[0]) <= min(b[1]) else min(b[1])  


min_of_b =  np.min(b)
# Exercise 3 - refactor the following maximum calculation to find the answer with numpy.
max_of_b = max(b[0]) if max(b[0]) >= max(b[1]) else max(b[1])

max_of_b = np.max(b)
# Exercise 4 - refactor the following using numpy to find the mean of b
mean_of_b = (sum(b[0]) + sum(b[1])) / (len(b[0]) + len(b[1]))

mean_of_b = np.mean(b)
# Exercise 5 - refactor the following to use numpy for calculating the 
# product of all numbers multiplied together.

for row in b:
    for number in row:
        product_of_b *= number

# Exercise 6 - refactor the following to use numpy to find the list of squares 
squares_of_b = []
for row in b:
    for number in row:
        squares_of_b.append(number**2)

squares_of_b = np.square(b)
# Exercise 7 - refactor using numpy to determine the odds_in_b
odds_in_b = []
for row in b:
    for number in row:
        if(number % 2 != 0):
            odds_in_b.append(number)

odds_in_b = b[b % 2 == 1]
# Exercise 8 - refactor the following to use numpy to filter only the even numbers
evens_in_b = []
for row in b:
    for number in row:
        if(number % 2 == 0):
            evens_in_b.append(number)

evens_in_b = b[b % 2 == 0]
# Exercise 9 - print out the shape of the array b.
b.shape

# Exercise 10 - transpose the array b.
np.transpose(b)

# Exercise 11 - res[hape the array b to be a single list of 6 numbers. (1 x 6)
b.flatten()

# Exercise 12 - reshape the array b to be a list of 6 lists, each containing only 1 number (6 x 1)
b.reshape(6,1)

## Setup 3
c = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

# HINT, you'll first need to make sure that the "c" variable is a 
# numpy array prior to using numpy array methods.
# Exercise 1 - Find the min, max, sum, and product of c.
np.min(c)

# Exercise 2 - Determine the standard deviation of c.
np.std(c)

# Exercise 3 - Determine the variance of c.
np.var(c)

# Exercise 4 - Print out the shape of the array c
print(c.shape)

# Exercise 5 - Transpose c and print out transposed result.
c.transpose()

output: array([[1, 4, 7],
               [2, 5, 8],
               [3, 6, 9]])

# Exercise 6 - Get the dot product of the array c with c.

np.sum(c * c.transpose())

# Exercise 8 - Write the code necessary to determine the product of c times c 
# transposed. Answer should be 131681894400.
np.product(c * (c.transpose()))
